# Capstone-Project

Developed by: Alfonso Chang, Duy le, & Nikolaus Siauw

We test the performance of the main 4 asset pricing models including: 
    (i) Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM), 
    (ii) International Modified CAPM, 
    (iii) Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT) and 
    (iv) Fama-French 
to estimate the cost of capital in developed and emerging markets, through the construction of an algorithm based Python language.


## How to Use

The algorithm of the four models and their data collection is wrapped in a dashboard that runs on top of Plotly Dash library with interface as shown below.

Users can run model-dash.py file or open dashboard.ipynb and run the script from Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab. Then, users can input the paramters as instructed in the dashboard interface. The algorithms will collect required data as well as fit it to the four models, and display the result on the dashboard.
